Nataly helps with Objects
<br /><br />
The Object is the building block of all JavaScript. The object prototype is how JavaScript deals with inheritance. 
<br /><br />
Objects have 3 types of properties. <br />
Own properties - these are the properties you will be most familiar with. They are created directly on the object.<br />
Prototype properties - these properties are found through the prototype chain. If JavaScript can't find a property in your own properties, it will search up the prototype chain.<br />
Property Accessors - These are defined with the setter/getter functions. <br />
