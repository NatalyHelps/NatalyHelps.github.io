<h1>Nataly helps with Objects</h1>
The Object is the building block of all JavaScript. The object prototype is how JavaScript deals with inheritance. 
<br /><br />
<h2>Objects have 3 types of properties.</h2>
<ol>
<li>Own properties - these are the properties you will be most familiar with. They are created directly on the object.</li>
<li>Prototype properties - these properties are found through the prototype chain. If JavaScript can't find a property in your own properties, it will search up the prototype chain.</li>
<li>Property Accessors - These are defined with the setter/getter functions.</li>
</ol>
 <br /> <br />
<h2>Constructor Function</h2>
<b>Constructor</b> - is a function, a special function, that is used to create and initialize objets of a particular type. When you create an object using a constructor, 
it inherits properties and methods defined within that constructor.
