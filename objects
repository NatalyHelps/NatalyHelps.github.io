Nataly helps with Objects

The Object is the building block of all JavaScript. The object prototype is how JavaScript deals with inheritance. 

Objects have 3 types of properties. 
Own properties - these are the properties you will be most familiar with. They are created directly on the object.
Prototype properties - these properties are found through the prototype chain. If JavaScript can't find a property in your own properties, it will search up the prototype chain.
Property Accessors - These are defined with the setter/getter functions.
